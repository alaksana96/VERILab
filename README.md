# VERILab

## Second Year Electronics Lab

### Overview
This repository is dedicated to the second year electronics lab taken at Imperial College London. The purpose of this lab was to develop our digital electronics skills learnt in year 1, and improve them by learning a hardware description language, namely **Verliog**. The full experiment can be viewed at Dr Peter Cheung's [Experiement Website](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/E2_Experiment)

#### The full experimental log book can be seen at: [OneNote Notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Av9X5xjYt35EhAsLSPBcMN8Nn_AE)
Each page is dedicated to a different week of the experiment:
* Part 1: Schematic to Verilog
* Part 2: Counters and FSM
* Part 3: Analogue I/O and SPI serial interface
* Part 4: Real-time Audio Signal Processing
